FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST). We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should become the FFT library of choice for most applications.
The latest official release of FFTW is version 3.3.10, available from our download page. Version 3.3 introduced support for the AVX x86 extensions, a distributed-memory implementation on top of MPI, and a Fortran 2003 API. Version 3.3.1 introduced support for the ARM Neon extensions. See the release notes for more information.

The FFTW package was developed at MIT by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson.

Versions 3.3.10 and 2.1.5 of FFTW may be downloaded from this site. Feel free to post FFTW on your own site, but be sure to tell us so that we can link to your page and notify you of updates to the software.
