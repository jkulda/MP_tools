MP_PDF

calculates the total and partial pair distribution functions (PDF) by direct sampling and binning atom distances between pairs of unit cells in the supercell. The present version employs solely the Monte-Carlo pseudo-random sampling using the new RANDOM_NUMBER intrinsic generator of GFORTRAN.

On input only the data types CELL and QUICK are eligible, the BULK data type doesn't permit to address the unit cells by position in an adequate manner. The number of Monte-Carlo events to be generated is specified in units of 10^7 cell pairs. One or a few units are sufficient for most purposes. Hence a medium sized supercell (> 10^4 atoms) provides enough data to generate a usable PDF set; in case of fractional occupancies the supercell size may need to be increased accordingly. In case of unstable atomic structures partial sampling of a larger number of snapshots (supercells) may be advisable. 

Uniform (unit) or neutron weights can be choosen for the PDF presentation. Proper inclusion of Xray formfactors calls for calculation of the structure factors (FT), not yet implemented. The resulting PDF distributions can be smoothed/broadened to emulate the resolution broadening of experimental data. These options are to be specified in the corresponding section of the .PAR file together with the PDF step and range and with the partial correlation atom pairs.

Output files in the .PS (graphics) and .TXT (PDF tables) formats can be generated apon request.
