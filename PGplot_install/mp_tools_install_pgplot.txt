A/ Linux UBUNTU/DEBIAN

Use APT to install the PGPLOT5 libraries
  sudo apt install pgplot5

Alternatively you may download the package from UBUNTU MULTIVERSE
  https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/20.04/ubuntu-multiverse-amd64/pgplot5_5.2.2-19.3build3_amd64.deb.html

You may still wish to get the original PGPLOT distribution package (cf. below) to get the demo sourcefiles 
and to compile (cf. the MPtools compile script) at least PGDEMO1.F for testing purposes.


B/ Mac OS X

Download both the pgplot tarfile and the specific configuration files for MacOSX created by Benjamin Weiner and copy/move them into
cd /usr/local/src/:
wget -cNS --retr-symlinks ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/pgplot5.2.tar.gz 
wget -cNS http://mingus.as.arizona.edu/~bjw/software/pgplot_macosx_conf.tar

Unpack the tarfiles:
tar -zxvf pgplot5.2.tar.gz 
cd /usr/local/src/pgplot/ 
tar -xvf ../pgplot_macosx_conf.tar

Create the installation directory in /usr/local (may need sudo):
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/pgplot
  cd /usr/local/pgplot/ 
and  copy there the drivers.list  
  cp /usr/local/src/pgplot/drivers.list .

to select the drivers edit the drivers.list: uncomment the drivers needed for MP_TOOLS:  
/NULL, /XSERVE, /PNG, /TPNG, /CPS, /VCPS
(TPNG is PNG with a transparent background)

Edit the configuration file for your system MacOSX (64bit) 
(you may need to copy the attached sys_macosx directory into /usr/local/src/pgplot)):
when using the GCC compiler suite (recommended), change the FCOMPL and CCOMPL lines to 
FCOMPL="/usr/local/bin/gfortran" 
CCOMPL="/usr/local/bin/gcc" 
(btw put SHARED_LIB="" so only the static library libpgplot.a will be generated).

Modify the file /usr/local/src/pgplot/makemake:
comment out the line 
  pndriv.o : ./png.h ./pngconf.h ./zlib.h ./zconf.h 
i.e.
  #pndriv.o : ./png.h ./pngconf.h ./zlib.h ./zconf.h 

Run MAKEMAKE 
cd /usr/local/pgplot/ 
/usr/local/src/pgplot/makemake /usr/local/pgplot macosx gfortran_gcc_64

Copy the corrected PNG driver into the drivers list (overwrite the original one)
  cp pndriv_corrected.c ./drivers/pndriv.c  
alternatively, to do the correction, edit the driver source pndriv.c to fix the pointer problem: 
setjmp(png_ptr->jmpbuf)   should be   setjmp(png_jmpbuf(png_ptr)) (line â‰ˆ255)

and then do the MAKE 
  make 
runs with (many) warnings, but hopefully no faults; once got through, do
  make clean 
The static library libpgplot.a should now be present in /usr/local/pgplot.

Check that there is no older version of LIBPGPLOT.A elsewhere in the linking path (/usr/local/lib);
but there is no point to move the new version there, because anyways the /usr/local/pgplot directory 
has to be added to the linking path (-L/usr/local/pgplot) to provide access to the other PGPLOT resources;

Linking a fortran code against pgplot needs to include the X11 and the PNG libraries:
/usr/local/bin/gfortran stuff.f -o stuff -ffixed-line-length-132 -L/usr/pkg/pgplot -lpgplot -lX11 -lpng 
on systems, where the X11 libraries are not part of standard configuration, you may need 
to add their path as well (-L/usr/X11/lib)
