The corrected PNG driver in most PGPLOT distributions resolves the original pointer bug, but keeps the obsolete image width (850), height (680) and - most importantly - the crude pitch of 85 ppi. The CPNDRIV_CORRECTED_HIRES.C version included here, in addition to the habitual pointer correction, passes those values to 2048, 2048 and 300 ppi, respectively. These permit to save bitmap output in adequate quality.

This is another reason to perform local compilation of the PGPLOT package, after the original PNG driver has been overwritten by its present version by   

      cp pndriv_corrected_hires.c ./drivers/pndriv.c

A/ Linux UBUNTU/DEBIAN

Use APT to install the PGPLOT5 libraries
  sudo apt install pgplot5

Alternatively you may download the package from UBUNTU MULTIVERSE
  https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/20.04/ubuntu-multiverse-amd64/pgplot5_5.2.2-19.3build3_amd64.deb.html

You may still wish to get the original PGPLOT distribution package (cf. below) to get the demo sourcefiles 
and to compile (cf. the MPtools compile script) at least PGDEMO1.F for testing purposes.

B/ Mac OS X

B.1. Intel Mac

(may use the script under B.2 with adequate modifications)

Download both the pgplot tarfile and the specific configuration files for MacOSX created by Benjamin Weiner and copy/move them into
cd /usr/local/src/:
wget -cNS --retr-symlinks ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/pgplot5.2.tar.gz 
wget -cNS http://mingus.as.arizona.edu/~bjw/software/pgplot_macosx_conf.tar

Unpack the tarfiles:
tar -zxvf pgplot5.2.tar.gz 
cd /usr/local/src/pgplot/ 
tar -xvf ../pgplot_macosx_conf.tar

Create the installation directory in /usr/local (may need sudo):
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/pgplot
  cd /usr/local/pgplot/ 
and  copy there the drivers.list  
  cp /usr/local/src/pgplot/drivers.list .

to select the drivers edit the drivers.list: uncomment the drivers needed for MP_TOOLS:  
/NULL, /XSERVE, /PNG, /TPNG, /CPS, /VCPS
(TPNG is PNG with a transparent background)

Edit the configuration file for your system MacOSX (64bit) 
(you may need to copy the attached sys_macosx directory into /usr/local/src/pgplot)):
when using the GCC compiler suite (recommended), change the FCOMPL and CCOMPL lines to 
FCOMPL="/usr/local/bin/gfortran" 
CCOMPL="/usr/local/bin/gcc" 
(btw put SHARED_LIB="" so only the static library libpgplot.a will be generated).

Modify the file /usr/local/src/pgplot/makemake:
comment out the line 
  pndriv.o : ./png.h ./pngconf.h ./zlib.h ./zconf.h 
i.e.
  #pndriv.o : ./png.h ./pngconf.h ./zlib.h ./zconf.h 

**** the corrections of MAKEMAKE can be carried out by the patch under B.2 ***

Run MAKEMAKE 
cd /usr/local/pgplot/ 
/usr/local/src/pgplot/makemake /usr/local/pgplot macosx gfortran_gcc_64

Copy the corrected PNG driver into the drivers directory (overwrite the original one)
  cp pndriv_corrected_hires.c ./drivers/pndriv.c  

alternatively, to do the correction, edit the driver source pndriv.c to fix the pointer problem: 
setjmp(png_ptr->jmpbuf)   should be   setjmp(png_jmpbuf(png_ptr)) (line ≈255)

and change the image size (lines ≈60) and pitch (lines ≈600)  


and then do the MAKE 
  make 
runs with (many) warnings, but hopefully no faults; once got through, do
  make clean 
The static library libpgplot.a should now be present in /usr/local/pgplot.

Check that there is no older version of LIBPGPLOT.A elsewhere in the linking path (/usr/local/lib);
but there is no point to move the new version there, because anyways the /usr/local/pgplot directory 
has to be added to the linking path (-L/usr/local/pgplot) to provide access to the other PGPLOT resources;

Linking a fortran code against pgplot needs to include the X11 and the PNG libraries:
/usr/local/bin/gfortran stuff.f -o stuff -ffixed-line-length-132 -L/usr/pkg/pgplot -lpgplot -lX11 -lpng 
on systems, where the X11 libraries are not part of standard configuration, you may need 
to add their path as well (-L/usr/X11/lib)  



B.2. Apple Silicon Mac under Monterrey

- do the following (after https://www.mail-archive.com/pdl-general@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00895.html):
		- be sure to have the 
				gfortran_cc_Monterrey.conf 
		  or
		        gfortran_cc_BigSur.conf
		  files in the appropriate sys subdirectory (here sys_darwin)
		  
		- execute the following commands (cf. below)
		- in case of fatal errors in the course of MAKE check the locations of libraries
		  between the *.conf file and reality
