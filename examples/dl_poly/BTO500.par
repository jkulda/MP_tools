# "new" .PAR format
#
# the order of the groups doesn't matter and only those really needed may be present,
# but caution is needed: the switches and input values may be used also by other program units 
#
# the items order WITHIN the groups matters!
# in case of modifying the MP_TOOLS code, add new items at the ends of the groups to keep backwards compatibility


mp_gen		#general switches 
1					# j_verb (0/1) verbose command line output 
0					# j_proc requested number of OpenMP parallel processes, 0 = automatic maximum (12 for 12 core PowerMac)
0					# j_shrec=0: SHELLS data won't be recorded even if exist, (1 = SHELL data, if exist, will be recorded)
0 				# j_grid=1 grid overlay on PG_PLOT graphs (0 = no grid)
timestep	# simmulation type: 'timestep' for MD, 'static' for DISCUS etc., append '_cell' (default), '_quick' or '_bulk' to specify data type
#					# the comment sign is recommended to terminate each section

0											# n_int integration width in time (number of snapshots, 0 = automatic choice Nfile/2)
0											# s_trig=2 (0=OFF) triger level of the speckle filter (log_2 ratio between neighbours); 2 is normal when using the Hann window in space; 
2											# j_weight=1 uniform weighting, 2 neutron b_coh; 3 Xray form-factors 
1											# j_xray=1 load the Xray form-factor parameter table
1 										# j_log=1 logarithmic scale for plots (0=linear) 
1 										# j_txt=1 accompany .PS output by recording map intensities to .txt file (always linear scale, speckle filter applied if active)
0											# j_oneph=1 	one-phonon approximation: start in NUFFT (0) or 1phonon (1), runtime toggle 0,1
