1/ Preparing to use MP_TOOLS

Copy the 'mp_tools_examples' subdirectory to a convenient place in your working space. 
Using any of its specific subdirectories as a template, create your own project directory, 
go there and create the ./data subdirectory, something like
	>mkdir my_project
	>cd ./my_project
	>mkdir data

Move the ACCII input (MD dump file and/or trajectory files etc.) of your project there
	>mv /volumes/whats_ever_somewhere/hist_200.txt ./data
or just make a link and place it into ./data
	>link /volumes/whats_ever/hist_200.txt ./data/hist_200.txt

It is a good idea to follow a convention that gives an intuitive name to all what follows,
eg. BZO200s for a BZO (BaZrO3) short sequence at 200K 
	>mv ./data/hist_200.txt ./data/PMN200s_200.txt
use upper and lower case to your convenience, all the MP_TOOLS input specifications are 
case-insensitive.

In your project directory create a <your_project>.par file (use the same name as above, 
i.e. BZO200s.par, for convenience, but not obligatorily). This file will contain info about your 
substance and option settings for some of the MP_TOOLS programs. Use the file BZO200e.par as a 
template, keywords like 'mp_bin', 'mp_pdf' etc. corresponding to the names of individual 
MP_TOOLS programs do have only a symbolic meaning, other tools than just the specified one
may use the information; each group has to be terminated by a comment (#) or empty (spaces) line;
when editing the contents mind to use spaces rather than tabs. 


2/ Using MP_TOOLS

Each routine offers a more-or-less intuitive command line dialog (cf. more detailed 
descriptions under mp_tools_code/docs

A/ Convert the input ASCII file data (DL_POLY, LAMMPS, DISCUS etc.) into binary format 
	(as a first, obligatory step) 

  Use the MP_BIN (DL_POLY), MP_LBIN (LAMMPS), MP_DBIN (DISCUS) tools to generate the
	binary direct access files to be used in subsequent work; each of the files will start 
	by a header record containing all the info from history file header (atom names, masses, 
	lattice parameters etc.), the binary files will be stored in ./data again; 
	if pertinent the programs determine real temperature from the kinetic energies of individual
	velocity components (separately for cores and shells) and refine corrections to the
	lattice parameters originally deduced from the supercell dimensions; a detailed output
	is produced for the first snapshot in the series automatically and can be extended to
	all of them by setting a switch in the .PAR file
	
	For series of snapshots the binary file names consist of a 'master' (a character chain 
	specified in the MP_BIN dialogue) followed by '_n' and a four digit number (BZN200_n0001.dat);
	the other tools ask then for this information in their input dialogues.
  		  
  
B/ Inspect the contents of the binary data files 

  MP_INSP prints the contents the header record of a binary data file and displays the
  information on individual atoms identified by their supercell indices. 
  		

C/ Visualise scattering functions and to extract related properties 

  MP_SQOM calculates and plots total, elastic and inelastic diffuse scattering intensity 
	maps over planes in reciprocal space as well as E(Q) cuts (dispersion-like) with  
	the possibility to save both tables of intensities in ASCII format (.txt) and the graphical 
	output in the .PS format; the use of non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to 
	pass from the direct to the reciprocal (momentum) space brings the usual computing time
	gain of â‰ˆ NlogN against the N^2 scale for normal FT, which can reach many orders of 
	magnitude for large systems; in addition the use of OpenMP parallelisation can be
	activated and is recommended in general (no reproducibility issues to be expected)  		

  MP_DOS calculates and plots the vibrational density of states; atom weights can be chosen 
	between uniform (1.) and neutron (b_coh, read from the .PAR file) with the 
	possibility to mask out any atom type

  MP_PDF accumulates and plots pair distribution functions (PDF) in direct space by Monte-
	Carlo sampling; OpenMP parallelisation is available if computation speed is of importance; 
	for high accuracy and 100% reproducibility the single process option should be checked

  
3/ Examples

The examples in this directory cover the three available ASCII input data styles: DL_POLY,
LAMMPS and DISCUS (including Ferrodo etc.). 

To keep the distribution size reasonable, the 
data sets extend only over a single or a few snapshots, permitting to test the basic
functions of MP_TOOLS: conversion to binary format, inspection of the binary data, plots
of total scattering intensities and generation of a PDF. The energy-resolved functionalities
calling for sequences of hundreds to thousands snapshots (10-100 Gb) need to be tried in 
'real life' circumstances.

The text files like lammps_cu_48.txt containing command line session logs, included in each 
case, permit to replay a brief tutorial session and give also the possibility to cross-check 
the details of data file structure. The included .PAR files can be used as templates for 
own projects.
